1,How common is HER-2/neu gene amplification in primary breast cancers?,HER-2/neu gene amplification was found in approximately 30% of primary breast cancers.,"Yes, the published data shows that amplification of HER-2/neu is a common finding in human mammary carcinoma cell lines. The data also shows that HER-2/neu amplification is associated with",0,0.2553191489361702
2,What is the highest level of HER-2/neu gene amplification observed in the study?,Amplification ranged up to more than 20-fold in some tumors.,"Yes, there was a significant correlation between HER-2/neu gene amplification and recurrence or survival (P = 0.002).",0,0.06666666666666667
3,What technique was used to detect HER-2/neu gene amplification?,A DNA dot blot assay using a HER-2/neu probe was used.,"Yes, there was a significant correlation between HER-2/neu gene amplification and estrogen receptor status (P = 0.001). There was no correlation between HER-2/neu gene amplification and progesterone receptor status (P = 0.15). There was a significant correlation between HER-2/neu gene amplification and size of tumors (P = 0.001). There was no correlation between HER-2/neu gene amplification",0,0.12987012987012986
4,How many primary breast cancer samples were examined?,The study examined 189 primary human breast cancer samples.,"Yes, the study found that HER-2/neu amplification was not associated with survival.",0,0.17391304347826086
5,Did the study find HER-2/neu amplification in benign breast diseases?,"No, HER-2/neu amplification was not found in benign breast disease samples.","Yes, the ongoing survey in our laboratory of proto-oncogene abnormalities in human tumors is part of an ongoing effort to identify genes that are involved in the development of human tumors. The goal of this study is to identify genes that are over",0,0.03508771929824561
6,What tumor features correlated with HER-2/neu amplification?,Tumor size and lymph node involvement were positively correlated with HER-2/neu amplification.,"Yes, the study found that the number of positive nodes was not a significant prognostic factor for relapse and overall survival in human breast cancer.",0,0.05128205128205128

8,Is HER-2/neu gene amplification associated with hormone receptor status?,The study did not find a significant correlation with estrogen or progesterone receptor status.,"Yes, the correlation between HER-2/neu gene amplification and estrogen re",0,0.23076923076923075
9,What prognostic implication does HER-2/neu amplification suggest?,HER-2/neu amplification may indicate a subset of breast cancer patients with a poor prognosis.,The results of,0,0.10526315789473684
10,What conclusion did the study make about HER-2/neu amplification?,HER-2/neu amplification defines a distinct subset of breast cancers and may have prognostic value.,The study had a small sample size and was limited by the use of a single method for gene amplification.,0,0.22222222222222224
