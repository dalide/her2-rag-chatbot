    "question": "Did the study find HER-2/neu amplification in benign breast diseases?",
    "answer": "No, HER-2/neu amplification was not found in benign breast disease samples."
  },
  {
    "question": "What tumor features correlated with HER-2/neu amplification?",
    "answer": "Tumor size and lymph node involvement were positively correlated with HER-2/neu amplification."

  {
    "question": "What percentage of tumors showed more than 10-fold amplification?",
    "answer": "14% of tumors showed more than 10-fold amplification."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is HER-2/neu gene amplification associated with hormone receptor status?",
    "answer": "The study did not find a significant correlation with estrogen or progesterone receptor status."
