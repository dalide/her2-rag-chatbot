To test this, univariate survival analyses were performed in which amplification was compared to relapse and survival in this patient group. A total of 35 patients had a recurrence ofthe disease, and 29 had died at the time of the analyses. Median times to relapse and death were 62 months and 69 months, respe...\n",

As a result of the published data showing amplification of HER2/neu in a human mammary carcinoma cell line, and as part of an ongoing survey in our laboratory of proto-oncogene abnormalities in human tumors, we evaluated alterations of the HER-2/neu gene in a large series of human primary breast cancers. Our results show that amplification of this gene occurs relatively frequently in breast cancer, and that it is ...\n",

      "The question of amplification of HER-2/neu in metastatic as compared to primary lesions in a given patient is important. The current study utilized only primary breast tumors for analyses. It would be of interest to determine if HER-2/neu copy number is altered as the tumor metastasizes. A recent study evaluating N-myc copy number in human small cell carcinoma of the lung showed no difference between primary and metastatic lesions (11).
